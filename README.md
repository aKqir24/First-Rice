# âœ‹ __Hi I am Akqir!!__
I'm just a normal computer systems student, and now I am studying `python`, `shell`, `powershell`, `html`, and `java` for my future plans in becoming a software enginer or just a normal web developer. My progress has been slow for a while, but I will try my what I can to be able to do it :)
